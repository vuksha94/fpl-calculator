 Web app for fantasy premier league managers: https://fantasy.premierleague.com/

For given sample of managers in the given league calculates 'TEAMS SELECTED BY' and 'CAPTAIN' percentage for each player in those teams.
Leagues can be private (any classic private league, usually small leagues up to 50 players) or public (Overall League, Nation League, Favourite Team League...)

With this data on mind, managers can get to know better which players are 'differentials' (players that aren't heavilly owned by other managers) or 'must-have' (heavilly owned players that can affect negativilly your ranking if they do well and you don't own them)
